Hey there! This is the public repository for the Christian Students United (CSU) Egg Hunt!
This project has taken a long time to make, and I hope, therefore will be a successful project for the school.

This project is meant to run on the cloud as a live game, so I'm also using Amazon AWS to run the project on the cloud, and with the help of WIX, i'm hosting a site for it.
The project is a 'Digital easter egg hunt' where you're supposed to hatch eggs, and have fun. All results are automatically plugged into a google sheets.
